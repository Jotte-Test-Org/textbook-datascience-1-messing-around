# Ethics and Pitfalls in Data Science
*Evelyn Campbell, Ph.D.*

*Data Ethics* is an emerging discipline that deals with the ethical circumstances and decisions made around the possession and use of data. Because data can involve information pertaining to and affecting human subjects, it is an extremely important consideration throughout the data life cycle.

As with other fields, such as sociology, psychology, medicine, business, and others, many ethical considerations are used to inform conduct centered around data. However, because data ethics is a new and developing discipline, there are currently no standardized parameters or exhaustive legislations that considerably guides ethical behavior and decisions pertaining to data. In this chapter, we will discuss essential considerations around ethics, current laws pertaining to data ethics, and an ethical framework to consider as it pertains to human data.
