    "This case study shows that you can answer important data science questions with the information you have learned so far in this book. Skills like grouping and merging, creating and dropping columns in DataFrames, and applying functions to a column are all extremely useful and used very often in data science.\n",

    "In addition, our investigation of traffic stops illustrates the wide variety of important data science projects. Projects like this have the potential to influence policy and legislation. Other data science projects can affect development of new medications or therapies, help understand history, or lead to technology like Chat-GPT or Google BARD. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, many of these projects involve additional statistical and computation skills like machine learning or being able to use large amounts of data from databases. These more advanced topics are what we will cover in Part 2 of this book."
